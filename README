** Receive images from Casio WQV-1/2 watch via an IR adapter **

Have tested it on WQV-2, it should work on other models as well. Based on the reverse engineered
spec by Marcus Gr√∂ber https://www.mgroeber.de/misc/wqvprot.htm. You'll need a serial USB IR adapter,
I used this one https://irdroid.eu/product/irdroid-usb-irda-transceiver-2/

How to: run the program, then on your watch go to "IR Comm", then "Others" and "Send". Select the image
to send and point to the IR adapter. In this mode, the watch will act as a computer that uploads images, 
so the receiver actually acts as another watch that receives images.

P.S. I'm not a Rust programmer, so the code is probably not very good.
